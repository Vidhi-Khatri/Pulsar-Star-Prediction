| Integrated Profile                           | A measure determine by folding time-domain data & summing for a given phase         | -----      |
| Signal-To-Noise Ratio (SNR)                  | The ration of the pulsar's signal to ambient noise                                  | -----      |
| Dispersion measure                           | How many electrons the signal passes through to get to earth                        | -----      |
| DM-SNR Curve                                 | A curve plotting the signal-to-noise ration (y) to the dispersion measure (x)       | -----      |
| Mean of the integrated profile               | Mean of the signal strength                                                         | Continuous |
